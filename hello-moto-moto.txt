Hello how are you doing this fine day of ours. 
So there will be plan of attack for this here:
-CHessboard & updating.
2d array x and y board[][]16 16
object called peice,
those objects are stored into the board.
1-15
|
15
move peice (type, )
update peice

char board[16][16];

draw grid, prints out the grid, at each space it checks the array to see if there is something there.
